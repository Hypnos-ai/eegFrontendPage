# Summary

NeuroSync is a comprehensive, open-source brain-computer interface (BCI) software suite that enables real-time electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing, adaptive machine learning classification, and direct device control. The software implements a novel combination of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) spatial filtering with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for motor imagery classification, providing a complete pipeline from raw EEG acquisition to real-time control commands. NeuroSync features a professional PyQt5 graphical user interface, supports OpenBCI hardware via BrainFlow integration, and includes comprehensive session management and data visualization capabilities. The software is available at https://www.hypnos.site/neurosync with downloadable installer applications and user documentation.

# Statement of need

Current brain-computer interface software tools are typically fragmented across different stages of the BCI pipeline, requiring researchers to integrate multiple specialized packages for signal acquisition, processing, machine learning, and real-time control [@Hossain:2023]. While established packages like MNE-Python [@Gramfort:2013] excel at offline EEG analysis, there is a significant gap in software that provides end-to-end BCI functionality with adaptive machine learning in a single platform.

Existing BCI software faces several limitations: most packages focus on either signal processing or machine learning but not both, real-time processing capabilities are often limited, hardware integration typically requires custom implementation, and adaptive learning algorithms are rarely implemented in production-ready systems [@Lotte:2018]. NeuroSync addresses these limitations by providing a unified platform that encompasses the entire BCI pipeline while introducing novel methodological contributions. The software's integration of CSP spatial filtering with DQN reinforcement learning represents a significant advance over traditional static classification approaches [@Nallani:2024].

# Software description

NeuroSync implements a complete BCI pipeline consisting of real-time EEG data acquisition and preprocessing, adaptive feature extraction using CSP spatial filtering, motor imagery classification using a custom DQN reinforcement learning architecture, and real-time device control with confidence-based filtering.

The software architecture integrates MNE-Python [@Gramfort:2013] for robust signal processing including filtering, artifact removal, and channel management. Hardware integration is achieved through BrainFlow, enabling support for OpenBCI Cyton and Ganglion boards. The core algorithmic innovation lies in the integration of CSP spatial filtering [@Blankertz:2007; @Ma:2023] with Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning. Traditional BCI systems rely on static classifiers that do not adapt to changing user states or environmental conditions. NeuroSync's adaptive DQN architecture continuously learns from user performance, implementing a novel conservative prediction system that reduces false positive control commands while maintaining high accuracy [@Nallani:2024].

The software provides real-time processing through optimized circular buffering with sub-second response times, adaptive machine learning with confidence-based filtering algorithms, a professional PyQt5 interface with session management and real-time visualization, OpenBCI hardware abstraction through BrainFlow integration, and comprehensive data management with automated organization and configuration persistence.

# Impact and Applications

NeuroSync enables researchers to develop and deploy BCI applications without requiring expertise in multiple specialized software packages or custom hardware integration. The software supports assistive technologies for motor-impaired individuals, neurofeedback systems, and research into adaptive brain-computer interfaces. The combination of research-grade algorithmic capabilities with an accessible user interface makes NeuroSync particularly valuable for translational research and longitudinal studies investigating BCI performance changes over time.

# Availability and Community

NeuroSync is released under an open-source license with complete source code available on GitHub. The software is available for download at https://www.hypnos.site/neurosync with installer applications for multiple operating systems and comprehensive user documentation. The modular architecture facilitates community development and enables researchers to extend the software for specialized applications while maintaining compatibility with the core BCI pipeline.
