# Summary

NeuroSync is a comprehensive, open-source brain-computer interface (BCI) software suite that enables real-time electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing, adaptive machine learning classification, and direct device control. The software implements a novel combination of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) spatial filtering with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for motor imagery classification, providing a complete pipeline from raw EEG acquisition to real-time control commands. NeuroSync features a professional PyQt5 graphical user interface, supports multiple EEG hardware platforms via BrainFlow integration, and includes comprehensive session management, data visualization, and model training capabilities. The software bridges the gap between research-grade BCI development and practical, deployable applications by providing both the underlying algorithmic framework and a user-friendly interface suitable for researchers, clinicians, and developers.

# Statement of need

Current brain-computer interface software tools are typically fragmented across different stages of the BCI pipeline, requiring researchers to integrate multiple specialized packages for signal acquisition, processing, machine learning, and real-time control [@Hossain:2023]. While established packages like MNE-Python [@Gramfort:2013] excel at offline EEG analysis and EEGLAB provides comprehensive signal processing capabilities, there is a significant gap in software that provides end-to-end BCI functionality with adaptive machine learning in a single, cohesive platform.

Existing BCI software faces several limitations: (1) most packages focus on either signal processing or machine learning but not both, (2) real-time processing capabilities are often limited or require significant additional development, (3) hardware integration typically requires custom implementation for each device, and (4) adaptive learning algorithms that can improve performance over time are rarely implemented in production-ready BCI systems [@Lotte:2018].

NeuroSync addresses these limitations by providing a unified platform that encompasses the entire BCI pipeline while introducing novel methodological contributions. The software's integration of CSP spatial filtering with DQN reinforcement learning represents a significant advance over traditional static classification approaches, enabling the system to adaptively improve its performance based on user feedback and environmental changes [@Nallani:2024].

# Software description

NeuroSync implements a complete BCI pipeline consisting of four main components: (1) real-time EEG data acquisition and preprocessing, (2) adaptive feature extraction using CSP spatial filtering, (3) motor imagery classification using a custom DQN-reinforcement learning architecture, and (4) real-time device control with confidence-based filtering.

## Architecture and Implementation

The software is built on a modular Python architecture that integrates several established neuroscience and machine learning libraries. EEG data acquisition and preprocessing leverage MNE-Python [@Gramfort:2013] for robust signal processing, including filtering, artifact removal, and channel management. Hardware integration is achieved through BrainFlow, enabling support for multiple EEG devices including OpenBCI, NeuroSky, and other research-grade systems.

The core algorithmic contribution lies in the integration of CSP spatial filtering [@Blankertz:2007; @Ma:2023] with Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning. Traditional BCI systems rely on static classifiers that do not adapt to changing user states or environmental conditions. NeuroSync's adaptive DQN architecture continuously learns from user performance, implementing a novel conservative prediction system that reduces false positive control commands while maintaining high accuracy for intended actions [@Nallani:2024].

## Key Features

- Real-time Processing Pipeline: NeuroSync implements an optimized circular buffering system with overlapping windows for continuous EEG processing, enabling sub-second response times suitable for real-time control applications.

- Adaptive Machine Learning: The software's DQN architecture incorporates confidence-based filtering and conservative prediction algorithms that improve system reliability over extended use periods, addressing a critical limitation of static BCI classifiers.

- Professional User Interface: A comprehensive PyQt5 graphical interface provides session management, real-time visualization, configuration management, and training progress monitoring, making the software accessible to non-programming researchers and clinicians.

- Hardware Abstraction: Through BrainFlow integration, NeuroSync supports multiple EEG hardware platforms with a unified interface, eliminating the need for device-specific implementations.

- Comprehensive Data Management: The software includes complete session management with automated data organization, annotation systems, and configuration persistence across experiments.

## Novel Methodological Contributions

NeuroSync's primary methodological innovation is the combination of CSP spatial filtering with DQN reinforcement learning for motor imagery classification [@Nallani:2024]. While CSP has been established as an effective spatial filtering technique for motor imagery BCIs [@Ang:2008; @Zhang:2019], and deep reinforcement learning has shown promise in various neural applications [@Li:2024], their integration for real-time BCI control represents a novel approach.

The software implements a multi-stage feature extraction pipeline that applies CSP transformations across multiple frequency bands, followed by time-domain and frequency-domain feature computation. These features are then processed by a custom DQN architecture that includes convolutional layers for temporal pattern recognition, LSTM networks for sequence modeling, and specialized output layers for motor imagery classification.

## Implementation Quality

NeuroSync demonstrates production-ready software engineering practices including comprehensive error handling, extensive logging, modular design with clear separation of concerns, and thorough input validation. The software includes sample data for immediate testing, comprehensive documentation, and example usage scenarios that facilitate adoption by the research community.

# Impact and Applications

NeuroSync enables researchers to develop and deploy BCI applications without requiring expertise in multiple specialized software packages or custom hardware integration. The software has been designed to support various BCI applications including assistive technologies for motor-impaired individuals, neurofeedback systems, and research into adaptive brain-computer interfaces.

The combination of research-grade algorithmic capabilities with a user-friendly interface makes NeuroSync particularly valuable for translational research, where algorithms developed in research settings need to be evaluated in more practical, real-world conditions. The software's adaptive learning capabilities also make it suitable for longitudinal studies investigating BCI performance changes over time.

# Availability and Community
